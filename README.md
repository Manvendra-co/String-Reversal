# String-Reversal
Reversing a string is the technique that reverses or changes the order of a given string so that the last character of the string becomes the first character of the string and so on.
Reversing a string:
In programming, each character of a string has an assigned index, starting from zero to length – 1. Index 0 starts from the first character and the last character's index is length – 1. Special characters and white spaces also have an assigned index.

For example: If we consider the string "Hello World";

Characters	H	e	l	l	o	 	W	o	r	l	d
Index	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
Here, the length will be 11 and the indexing will be from 0 to 10.
